This is a web app that connects to your spotify account and collects information about your music preferences, including artists in your music library stored on your computer, as well as playlists you have (either on your local machine or created by spotify). It will also take into account which artists you listen to most often and/or which artists you listen to the most songs by. From here, the app can connect to the tastedive API to find artists similar to the ones in your library and playlists, and it can begin to build a list of artists to search for concerts. At this point, the app may be able to use the concerts feature that spotify already has, or it may connect to the bandsintown API to find concerts near you for the compiled list of bands and artists.
